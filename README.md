# Social Network API
## About
For this project, I created a backend social network API using NodeJS, ExpressJS, and MongoDB. There are three schemas- Users, Thoughts, and Reactions- and two tables - Users and Thoughts. Using a REST API, such as insomnia, you can create, update, and delete users and thoughts, add and delete a user's friend, and add and delete reactions to thoughts.  I particularly struggled with creating routes for reactions and adding friends.
